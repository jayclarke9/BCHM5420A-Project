A Repository for Investigating Spaceflight-Induced Gene Expression Changes in the Rodent Brain

This repository contains a bioinformatics pipeline and downstream analysis for investigating gene expression changes in the hippocampus of rodents exposed to spaceflight. Specifically, the project focuses on the expression of Ptgds and Cdkn2d, two genes previously identified as significantly upregulated in spaceflight conditions. The analysis uses publicly available RNA-seq data from the NASA GeneLab database (Study OSD-612, GLDS-588).
